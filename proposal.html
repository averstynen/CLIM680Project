# Using TROPOMI Measurements as Indicators of Wildfires

For my final project, I will be using NO<sub>2</sub> data from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite.
I will be using daily satellite observations during the months of August, September, and October for the years 2019-2021. I will specifically be focusing
on the state of California.
