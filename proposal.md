# Using TROPOMI Measurements as Indicators of Wildfires

For my final project, I will be using NO<sub>2</sub> data from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite.
I will be using daily satellite observations during the months of August, September, and October for the years 2019-2021. I will specifically be focusing
on the state of California.

During the months of August and September 2020, there were two large fires that impacted regions of California. Using the TROPOMI satellite, we are able to
observe column measurements of nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and Formaldehyde. This project will focus mainly on nitrogen dioxide and carbon
monoxide.
